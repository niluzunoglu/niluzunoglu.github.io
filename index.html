								<p>
									Currently, I am working as a backend developer at KutuAI, where I use Python as programming language and 
									Django as framework.

									I gained valuable experience as an intern and junior software engineer at Sparta, a cyber security company where I worked on web applications and web application security. 

									<br><br>

									I'm always eager to learn new technologies and take on new challenges, and I'm passionate about building 
									scalable and efficient systems that can handle complex data processing and analysis.

											I'm proud to have been a part of a team that made a real-world impact through our project on "Sepsis Detection and Treatment using Machine Learning." 
											Our project was the first of its kind in Turkey and aimed to improve the detection and treatment of sepsis using machine learning. 
											Thanks to our efforts, we were able to shed light on the importance of early diagnosis and timely intervention in treating this life-threatening condition.
											I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to work with my team on this challenging project and to contribute to improving healthcare in Turkey. 
											This project reinforced my belief in the power of technology and data analysis to make a positive impact in people's lives. I look forward to continuing to explore the potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence in healthcare and other fields.

												Outside of my work as a software engineer, I have a passion for military aviation. 
												In my free time, you can often find me spotting, where I enjoy observing and learning about different types of aircraft. 
												My favorite jet plane is the F-16, and I'm a huge fan of Solotürk, 
												the F-16 demo team based in Turkey.
												
												I find that my hobby helps me stay curious and engaged, and I'm always looking for ways to apply what I learn to my work as a software engineer.
