									<h2>About Me</h2>
								</header>

								<p>
									I'm a software engineer with a strong focus on backend development and artificial intelligence systems. My work sits at the intersection of code, data, and curiosity — particularly where complex systems meet real-world impact.
									<br><br>
									I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at Ankara University in June 2022. Currently, I’m pursuing a thesis-based Master’s degree in Computer Engineering at Yıldız Technical University. My graduate studies have included advanced coursework in machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and modern software architectures.
									<br><br>
									Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I’m deeply fascinated by space technologies and intelligent systems designed for aerospace applications. This interest continues to inspire both my career path and the projects I choose to undertake.
									<br><br>
									This website is a reflection of my journey — a place where I share selected projects, ideas I’ve explored, and the occasional deep-dive into topics that excite me.
									<br><br>
									Feel free to reach out if you’d like to collaborate, discuss an idea, or just talk about building smart systems — on Earth or beyond.

									<h2>Work</h2>
								</header>

								<p>

									I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Turkish Aerospace, where I focus on developing robust and scalable software systems for aerospace applications. Over the past two years, I’ve been contributing to various projects involving high-performance computing, complex data processing, and system integration.
									<br><br>
									Previously, I worked as a backend developer at KutuAI, where I primarily used Python and the Django framework to build web-based solutions.
									<br><br>
									I also gained valuable experience as an intern and junior software engineer at Sparta, a cybersecurity company, where I worked on web applications and web application security.
									<br><br>
									I’m always eager to explore new technologies, take on challenging problems, and build efficient systems that can make a real impact.

											I'm proud to have been a part of a team that made a real-world impact through our project on "Sepsis Detection and Treatment using Machine Learning." 
											Our project was the first of its kind in Turkey and aimed to improve the detection and treatment of sepsis using machine learning. 
											Thanks to our efforts, we were able to shed light on the importance of early diagnosis and timely intervention in treating this life-threatening condition.
											I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to work with my team on this challenging project and to contribute to improving healthcare in Turkey. 
											This project reinforced my belief in the power of technology and data analysis to make a positive impact in people's lives. I look forward to continuing to explore the potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence in healthcare and other fields.

												Outside of my work as a software engineer, I have a passion for military aviation. 
												In my free time, you can often find me spotting, where I enjoy observing and learning about different types of aircraft. 
												My favorite jet plane is the F-16, and I'm a huge fan of Solotürk, 
												the F-16 demo team based in Turkey.
												
												I find that my hobby helps me stay curious and engaged, and I'm always looking for ways to apply what I learn to my work as a software engineer.
